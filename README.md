## 📊 Dataset Release Status
![Dataset Release](https://img.shields.io/badge/Dataset%20Release-Upon%20Acceptance-orange)

We are committed to open and reproducible research.

The ELVID dataset, which includes aligned infrared–visible video pairs, is currently withheld to preserve the integrity of the peer-review process.

We guarantee that the complete dataset will be made publicly available immediately upon manuscript acceptance.


## 🔑 Code and Model Release Status
![Code Release](https://img.shields.io/badge/Code%20Release-Upon%20Acceptance-orange)

We are committed to full reproducibility and open science.

The source code, trained models, and detailed setup instructions are currently withheld to preserve the integrity of the academic peer-review process.

We guarantee that the complete repository contents (including training scripts and pretrained checkpoints) will be made publicly available immediately upon manuscript acceptance.
